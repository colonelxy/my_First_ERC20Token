# Build ERC20 token on top of the Ethereum blockchain

## What is an Ethereum Token?

Ethereum is an open software platform based on blockchain technology that enables developers to build and deploy decentralized applications. Many dApps have their own token built on top of the Ethereum network to crowdfund or run the dApps.

In this tutorial, we'll be building a ERC20 standard token that is capable of the following:

    checking balances
    transfer tokens
    transfer tokens from an address to another
    approve account(s) to withdraw tokens
    display amount approved for withdrawal between two accounts
